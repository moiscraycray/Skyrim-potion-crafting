This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is dependant on [React Autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest).

This app was created to be a companion to the video game [The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim). The player can make potions by combining the correct ingredients. To do so, the player will need ingredients with at least one identical property (effects). For example, to brew a 'Restore health' potion, the ingredients (e.g. blisterwort, wheat) must have the 'restore health' property.

To use the app, click on any effect on the list or type the desired effect in the search bar.
